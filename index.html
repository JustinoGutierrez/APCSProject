      <h2>Types of Trees</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Jacaranda</li>
        <p>- The most striking feature of the Jacaranda tree is its profusion of lavender or purple trumpet-shaped flowers that blanket the tree during its blooming season. The flowers form dense clusters that create a spectacular display, turning the tree into a canopy of purple hues.</p>

        <li>Japanese Maple</li>
        <p>- The tree's most distinctive feature is its delicate, palm-shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and finely serrated. The leaves showcase a wide array of colors, ranging from vibrant green in spring and summer to brilliant shades of red, orange, and gold in autumn. The foliage creates a captivating display, adding a touch of elegance and beauty to any setting.</p>

        <li>Cherry Blossom</li>
        <p>- The Cherry Blossom tree, also known as Sakura, is a symbol of beauty, renewal, and the transient nature of life. These trees are famous for their spectacular display of delicate, pink or white flowers that blanket the branches in a breathtaking spectacle, attracting visitors from around the world.</p>

        </center>
        <li>Wisteria</li>
        <p>The most notable feature of the Wisteria tree is its abundance of pendulous flower clusters, which hang gracefully from the branches in spring or early summer, depending on the variety and climate. The flowers are typically shades of lavender, purple, pink, or white, and they bloom in long, cascading racemes that can reach lengths of up to 1-2 feet (30-60 centimeters). The sight of these delicate, fragrant flowers hanging in profusion is truly captivating.</p>

        <li>Rainbow Eucalyptus</li>
        <p>One of the most striking features of the Rainbow Eucalyptus is its bark. As the tree matures, the outer layer of its trunk sheds in patches, revealing a stunning display of colors that range from pale green and blue to vibrant hues of orange, purple, maroon, and even brown. These vivid colors are caused by the shedding of the outer bark, which exposes the newly formed inner bark. Over time, the inner bark ages and transitions through a spectrum of colors, creating a breathtaking natural work of art.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Trees</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>Trees are not just aesthetically pleasing; they provide a multitude of benefits that contribute to the well-being of our planet and all living beings. </p>
        <li>Improving air quality</li>
        <p>Carbon Sequestration: Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases and helping to mitigate climate change.</p>
        <p>Through the process of photosynthesis, trees release oxygen, ensuring the availability of clean air for humans and wildlife.</p>
        <p>Trees act as natural air filters, removing pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter, thereby improving air quality and reducing respiratory problems.</p>
        <li>Reducing energy costs</li>
        <p>Trees provide shade, reducing the need for air conditioning and lowering energy consumption, which translates into cost savings.</p>
        <li>Providing wildlife habitat</li>
        <p>Habitat Restoration: Trees play a crucial role in restoring and rehabilitating degraded ecosystems, creating suitable habitats for wildlife and supporting ecological resilience.</p>
        <p>Forests and trees along water bodies help regulate water flow, improve water quality, and protect aquatic ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Pollination and Seed Dispersal: Trees provide food and shelter for pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and birds, ensuring the pollination of flowering plants and the dispersal of seeds.</p>
        <p>Wildlife Conservation: Trees support a diverse range of animal species, providing nesting sites, food sources, and protection from predators.</p>
        <li>Enhancing property value</li>
        <p>Well-maintained trees and green spaces increase property values, making neighborhoods and commercial areas more desirable.</p>
